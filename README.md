# First-Website
This is my first implementation of a website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript from CS50's course, week 8. 

# Personal Opinion
I am not a fan of this website and did not go further due to my lack of abilities at the time. Decided to take on another website development course in the meantime and will reimplement this website as CS50's final project assignment.
